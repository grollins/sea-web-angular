            <strong>SEA Water: a new computational model for water as a solvent.</strong>
            &nbsp; For many processes in chemistry and biology, water is the solvent. To study those processes using computer models requires good computational models of the physics of water. To learn more about waterâ€™s physical properties, we have studied simplified statistical mechanical models of water (such as the MB model, <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B8-GiITevaAxS1RFWkxBeWUzOFU/papers/jchemphys_132_224507.pdf" target="_blank">T. Urbic and K. A. Dill, <em>J Phys Chem</em>, 2010)</a> and we have performed computer simulations of atomically detailed models of aqueous solvation (see <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B8-GiITevaAxS1RFWkxBeWUzOFU/papers/jp709958f.pdf" target="_blank">D. L. Mobley et all, <em>J Phys Chem B</em>, 2008</a>; also see <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B8-GiITevaAxS1RFWkxBeWUzOFU/papers/fennell.pdf" target="_blank">C. J. Fennell et al, <em>J Phys Chem B</em>, 2009</a>). Those studies have guided us towards a new water model, called SEA (Semi-explicit Assembly) that encapsulates the physics in an efficient way.  Our goal is for SEA be as fast as "implicit" solvent and as physical as "explicit" solvent (<a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja906399e?journalCode=jacsat" target="_blank">C. J.
